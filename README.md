# File Structure
The project files are divided into components, each "item" representing a component

# Challenges Faced
I had some issues when formatting the application to look as good as possible for the user.  
I solved this by moving around some of the components and experimenting with grid layout.  
For example I merged 2 components into 1 as they were better of as 1 and it made it easier to organize.
