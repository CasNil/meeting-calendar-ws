# File Structure
The project files are divided into components, each "file" representing a component

# Challenges Faced
I had some issues when formatting the application to look as good as possible for the user.  
I solved this by moving around some of the components and experimenting with grid layout.  
For example I merged 2 components into 1 as they were better of as 1 and it made it easier to organize.

# Future Improvements
For future improvements I would like to implement a login function so that each user can login/create an account and save their meetings on their account.  
I would also like to make it so that when you add "Participants" to a meeting it should add the meeting into that users meetinglist, (If the user is registered with the right email). This would help companies but also regular users when planning meetings and inviting participants to meeting.
